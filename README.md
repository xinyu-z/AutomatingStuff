# AutomatingStuff
This is my Hello World repository.

[Tsuyoku Naritai!](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DoLQN5ryZ9XkZjq5h/tsuyoku-naritai-i-want-to-become-stronger) There, I made a link.

Simple and novice-level codes to automate simple tasks. The name of the repository is intended as a VP rather than an NP, if you care at all.


Apparently you get a PRO tag when you are an **edu** user.
