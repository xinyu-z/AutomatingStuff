# AutomatingStuff
This is my Hello World repository.

Simple and novice level codes to automate simple tasks. The name of the repository is intended as a VP rather than an NP, if you care at all.

And this line right here is to experiment what happens when I make a change in one branch.

Apparently you get a PRO tag when you are an **edu** user.
